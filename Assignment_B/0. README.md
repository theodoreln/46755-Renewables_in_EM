# 46755 Renewables in electricity markets - Group 5 
Explanation on the files & scripts that were used to solve and explain the results of the 2nd assignment.
All the files and code consists mainly of functions and the parameters/inputs for the executable part can be found at the very end of each python file alongside instructions on how to use them. Functions from different files are imported and called when needed.

----------------------------
----------------------------
"Data.py"

Database for import, creation and edit of dataframes & dictionaries that will be used for the different steps of the assignment. Essential data sets, for each step down the line, are imported from this file. In-sample scenarios are created here and used for every step down the line. 

----------------------------
----------------------------
"Step_1_2.py"

File for optimization of participating in the energy market under 1 & 2 price scheme and deriving quantity and expected profit. It compromises 4 different functions, and raw code used for plot creation, where:

1) Offering_one_price
	Given the sample of scenarios the function returns the hourly quantity offered at the DA market and the expected profit of whole day, under the 1 price scheme.
2) Offering_two_price
	Given the sample of scenarios, coefficient for up regulation price (during power system deficit), and coefficient for down regulation price (during power system excess)  the function returns the hourly quantity offered at the DA market, and the expected profit of whole day.
3) Profits_scenarios
	Given the sample of scenarios, the optimal hourly quantity offered at the DA market, and the price scheme the function returns a list of profits under each realized scenario.
4) Show_distribution
	A plot function that graphically demonstrates the distribution of profits with a histogram given the number of bins
5) Raw code
	Included under the main part calling all the function, this raw code practically creats a plot showcasing the differnce in bidding strategy, under 2 price scheme, when different balancing market price coeficcients are tested.

----------------------------
----------------------------
"Step_1_3.py"

File where the optimization problem of quantity bidding for DA market and its expected profit sustains a risk-analysis based on market playe's risk-averse, or not, strategy. It consists of 3 functions:

1) Offering_one_price_risk
	Given the sample of scenarios, and a weight "beta" the function returns the hourly quantity offered at the DA market and the expected profit of whole day, under the 1 price scheme.
2) Offering_two_price_risk
	Given the sample of scenarios, and a weight "beta" the function returns the hourly quantity offered at the DA market and the expected profit of whole day, under the 2 price scheme.
3) beta_iteration
	Given the sample of scenarios, price scheme as a number (1 or 2), max value of weight "beta" (always 1 under they way this optimization problem is formulated), and step that weight "beta" is increased the function iterates "beta" starting from 0 and increasing by the step given as long as the values is less than 1. Then it outputs 2 line graphs both for 1 & 2 price schemes.

----------------------------
----------------------------
"Step_1_4.py"

Firstly, the out-of sample simulations is done. Here the optimal quantity for the two price and the one price scheme is taken (While using the generated out-of sample scenarios) and the profit is calculated with Profits_scenarios (Step_1_2).

Secondly the same process is applied for the in-sample scenarios.

----------------------------
----------------------------
"Step_1_5.py"

File with raw code

----------------------------
----------------------------
"Step_1_additional.py"

File for implementing a sensitivity analysis on zeta under different balancing market price coefficients, to figure how it impacts bidding quantity. It consists of 2 functions:

0) Offering_two_zeta
    Given the sample of scenarios, coefficient for up regulation price (during power system deficit), and coefficient for down regulation price (during power system excess)  the function returns the hourly quantity offered at the DA market, and the expected profit of whole day.
1) Iterate_Z
    Function that takes as input a sample of 250 scenarios and then uses "Offering_two_zeta", just for a single hour, under different BM price coefficients and has  a plot as an output.

----------------------------
----------------------------
"Step_2.py"

File for evaluating Energinet's P90 rule for bidding for FCR-D UP regulation under the methods of ALSO-X and CVAR, and showcasing the reults of the evaluation. It consists of 7 functions:

1) P90_ALSO_X
    This function is taking as input the in sample scenarios and the propability of not meeting the bid offeref ("epsilon") and gives the optimal reserve capacity bid quantity to be offered in the FCR-D UP market, using the ALSO-X method.
2) P90_CVAR
    This function is taking as input the in sample scenarios and the propability of not meeting the bid offered ("epsilon") and gives the optimal reserve capacity bid quantity to be offered in the FCR-D UP market, using the CVAR method.
3) P90_verify
    Given the optimal quantity acquired using any method, out of sample scenarios, and the propability of not meeting the bid offered the functiom gives a list for each scenario stating how much energy was not delivered (0 if everything was delivered) every minute under what was bidded, a counter that counts all the occasion that the WF failed to deliver for each minute, and finaly a decision variable that states is the P90 condition is fullfiled (0 is not). 
4) Shortage_plot
    Plot function showcasing the number of shortages under the different evaluation methods 
5) Plotting_CFD
    Plot function extra
6) Effect_epsilon
    Function generating different values of propability of not meeting the bid offered
7) Heat_map
    Plot function showcasing effect of in-sample scenarios and propability of not meeting the bid offered on power shortage and compliance with P90 rule using the ALSO-X method.
